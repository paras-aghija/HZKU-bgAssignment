- Ans 1 : Smart contract is a program with defined logic to perform a set of tasks. Smart contract is deployed on a decentralized network called blockchain. Blockchain consists of multiple nodes in the network. To deploy our contract we need one of these nodes. A fees is charged in return of deploying the contract. Smart contract once deployed cannot be modified or changes therefore it is necessary to test the functionalities properly before deploying (on mainnet).

- Ans 2 : Blockchain is maintained and updated by nodes (computers running tasks for blockchain). Users are charged some fee to make updates on blockchain. Gas acts as a fuel to keep the blockchain running. Gas optimisation is important for big contracts as high gas fee for a transaction will make the contract inefficient.

- Ans 3 : Hash is a secret code which has been derrived from a message using some function. We can use this hash to share data between specefic users. Only users with the secret key to decipher the hash code can retrieve the message. Their are many different hashing techniques people use to hide information and share data securely.

- Ans 4 : I will take two envelopes and put it over the two objects. I will ask the colorblind person to open the envelopes to satisfy himself. I would repeat these steps unless the person is convinced. In this way it is proved that two objects have different colors without person gaining any information about the objects.
